### Key Features:

* **Auto-Deployment:** Uses GitHub Actions/Pages to update the site instantly on every push.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
* **Lightweight:** Zero dependencies; built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🛠️ How it was Built

1. **HTML5/CSS3:** Structured for semantic SEO and styled with modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid).
2. **GitHub Pages:** Configured via the repository settings to serve content from the `main` branch.
3. **Custom Domain Ready:** Though currently using the `*.github.io` suffix, this structure is ready for a custom CNAME.
